# MR
We used gut microbiota as exposure variables,and their summary statistics were obtained from the MiBioGen study(https://mibiogen.gcc.rug.nl/). We also selected genetic variants that were strongly associated (p < 1e-5, F > 10) and removed those in linkage disequilibrium to improve the robustness of the analysis. As outcome variables,we used ASD data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Genome-Wide Association Study(https://pgc.unc.edu/for-researchers/download-results/). We then we performed data harmonization and used the inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, simple mode,weighted model, and weighted median method to perfome Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine a causal relationship between the gut microbiota and ASD. We also used MR Egger intercept test, Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO),and leave-one-out analysis to identify heterogeneity and pleiotropy.
